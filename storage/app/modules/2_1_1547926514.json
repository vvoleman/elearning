We will create a simple laravel application in which we will guess users timezone from the front end and store in users table to format all the timestamp based on this timezone.\n\nWhat\u2019s timezone?\nYou probably already know the timezone, its the change in time for a different location in the world, for example, If here in India currently time is 6:44 AM then at this right moment in US it\u2019s 8:15 PM. This gets tricky to show correct time to another user if we don\u2019t apply the offset value for logged in user from US. By default laravel stores all the date time in the database using UTC.\n\nIf your application is only dealing with the users of a specific country then you don\u2019t need to anything, just change the app config timezone to match your areas timezone, it can be anything from PHP\u2019s timezone identifier. In case of US  New York, you can change config\/app.php timezone to:"}},{"type":"img","context":{"src":"https:\/\/images.mentalfloss.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/mf_image_16x9\/public\/527175-istock-514622028.jpg?itok=7pVBZr-X&resize=1100x1100","desc":"Raccoona matatafff"}}]}]}]}}
